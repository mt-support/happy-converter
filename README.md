![Demonstration of migrating events from Sugar Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mt-support/happy-converter/master/docs/media/basic-workflow.gif)

This plugin offers a means of migrating events from a different calendar plugin across to The Events Calendar. Currently, only Sugar Calendar (Lite) is supported and it has not been widely tested.

### Steps

* Install The Events Calendar in the same site where you originally used Sugar Calendar (Lite).
* Deactivate that unused plugin if you like.
* Navigate to the **Tools ‣ TEC Happy Converter** admin screen.
* If it detects the presence of Sugar Calendar event data, and if it thinks some of them have not yet been moved to The Events Calendar, it will allow you to run the tool.
